## Project Objective

The primary objective is to analyze the company's sales data for the German and Poland markets to provide actionable insights for different stakeholders within the organization. The requirements were divided based on the target audience:

|Requirement ID|Audience|Requirement Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|DM-DA01-REQ-1|Executive Committee|Provide a high-level overview of the companyâ€™s sales performance by year, month, customer city, and channel/sub-channel. Highlight top-performing drug classes, specific drugs, and customer cities.|
|DM-DA01-REQ-2|Sales Manager/Sales Rep|Deliver a detailed breakdown of sales by distributor and product, identify top customers and cities, and show sales splits by various channels.|
|DM-DA01-REQ-3|Head of Sales|Create a comprehensive report on sales team performance, detailing sales by team for each product and product class. Identify top-performing managers and reps, and allow for data filtering by year and month.|

## Tools Used

  * **Power BI Desktop**: For data modeling, analysis, and report creation.
  * **Power Query Editor**: For data cleaning, transformation, and preparation.
  * **Python (pandas)**: Used for initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to check data quality, handle missing values, and understand data distributions.

## Solution Approach

1.  **Data Exploration (EDA)**: The raw `.csv` dataset was initially inspected using the pandas library in Python to identify and handle any inconsistencies, missing values, or outliers.
2.  **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: In Power Query Editor, column headers and data types were corrected to ensure data integrity before modeling.
3.  **Data Modeling**: A star schema data model was built in Power BI to optimize performance and usability. The initial single-table dataset was split into dimension and fact tables.
4.  **Report & Dashboard Creation**: Three interactive, multi-page reports were developed in Power BI to address the specific requirements of the executive team, sales managers, and the head of sales.

## Data Model

To facilitate efficient analysis, the data was modeled into a **star schema**. This structure separates the quantitative sales data (facts) from the descriptive, categorical data (dimensions). This model improves query performance and simplifies the creation of complex analytics.

The model consists of one central `FACT-sales` table connected to nine dimension tables:

  * **Fact Table**: `FACT-sales` (contains metrics like Price, Quantity, Sales)
  * **Dimension Tables**: `DIM-channel`, `DIM-subchannel`, `DIM-country`, `DIM-city`, `DIM-distributor`, `DIM-customer`, `DIM-month`, `DIM-product`, `DIM-sales-rep`, and `DIM-sales-team`.
